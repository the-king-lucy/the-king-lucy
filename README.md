# Hi, I’m Lucy King
I'm a journalist who is interested in how the latest tech can help facilitate better, more efficient and more beautiful reporting. I have 16 years of experience and over that time I have worked for the BBC, Vice News, Discovery, Disney and the New York Times. You can find out more about me on my website www.thekinglucy.com

## I'm interested in data, visual journalism and investigations
I want to produce new and useful information and share it with an audience in a visually engaging and understandable way.

## I’m currently learning Javascript, HTML, CSS and Python
I experiment with visual journalism here www.thehandsomereport.com

## I'm always interested in collaborating on tech-first investigations
I think we can achieve more if we reach across borders and tech specialities to collaborate. Hit me up
