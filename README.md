These two quotes from veteran journalists perhaps best speak to how I see our role as journalists:
      
Martha Gellhorn, from 'Faces of War' (written in 1959, could have been written yesterday): 

        "When I was young I believed in the perfectibility of man, and in                     progress, and thought of journalism as a guiding light.  If people were told          the truth, if dishonor and injustice were clearly shown to them, they would           at once demand the saving action, punishment of wrong-doers, and care for the         innocent. How people were to accomplish these reforms, I did not know. That           was their job. A journalist's job was to bring news, to be eyes for their             conscience. I think I must have imagined public opinion as a solid force,             something like a tornago, always ready to blow on the side of angels.

        During the years of my energetic hope, I blamed the leaders when history              regularly went wrong, when cruelty and violence were tolerated or abetted,            and the innocent never got anything except the dirty end of the stick. The            leaders were a vague interlocking directorate of politicians, industralists,          newspaper owners, financiers: unseen, cold, ambitious men. "People" were              good, by definition; if they failed to behave well, that was because of               ignorance or helpnessness. 

        It took nine years and a great depression, and two wars ending in defeat, and         one surrender without war, to break my faith in the benign power of the               press. Gradually I came to realise that people will more readily swallow lies         than truth, as if the taste of lies was homey, appetizing, a habit. (There            were also liars in my trade, and leaders have always used facts as relative           and malleable. The supply of lies was unlimited.) Good people, those who              opposed evil wherever they saw it, never increased beyond a gallant minority.         The manipulated millions could be aroused or soothed by any lies. The guiding         light of journalism was no stronger than a glow worm." 
        
  Phillip Meyer, Precision Journalism

        "The World has become so complicated, the growth of available information so          explosive, that the journalist needs to be a filter, as well as a                     transmitter; an organizer and interpreter, as well as one who gathers and             delivers facts... The model of the journalism as a passive innocent had at            least one virtue: It provided a kind of discipline. It was consistent with            the tradition of objectivity.. But the objectivity model was designed for a           simpler world, one where unadorned facts can speak for themselves.... A               better solution is to push journalism toward science, incorporating both the          powerful data-gathering and analysis tools of science and its disciplined             search for verifiable truth."

To me, Visual and Data Journalism is the best antedote we have to the allure of misinformation. And the best way we can make sense of this complicated world full of information, is to find ways of efficiently filtering and analyzing it.
