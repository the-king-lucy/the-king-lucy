# Hi, Iâ€™m Lucy King
I'm a data-driven journalist who is interested in how the latest tech can help facilitate better, more efficient and more beautiful reporting. I have 16 years of experience in news, documentary and video. Over that time I have worked for the BBC, Vice News, Discovery, Disney and the New York Times. 

## I'm interested in data, visual journalism and investigations
In a nutshell? I want to get to the bottom of things. And once I've figured out what's going on, I want the information to so beautiful that the public want to understand it.

## I'm always interested in collaborating on tech-first investigations
I think we can achieve more if we reach across borders and tech specialities to collaborate. Always interested in hearing ideas for data-driven investigations
