# Hi, I’m Lucy King
I'm a journalist who is interested in how the latest tech can help facilitate better, more efficient and more beautiful reporting. I have 16 years of experience and over that time I have worked for the BBC, Vice News, Discovery, Disney and the New York Times. You can find out more about me on my website www.thekinglucy.com

## Data, visual journalism and investigations are my thing
I'm interested in using reporting to find new and useful information and share it with an audience in a visually engaging and understandable way.

## I’m currently learning Javascript, HTML, CSS and Python
I experiment with visual journalism here www.thehandsomereport.com

## Always interested in collaborating on tech-heavy investigations
I think we can achieve more if we reach across borders and tech specialities and collaborate. Please reach out with any good ideas.
